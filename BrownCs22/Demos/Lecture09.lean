# Sets in Lean

Today we'll talk about sets in Lean!

Remember that, when we take the *complement* of a set `A`,
we have to do this relative to some "universe" of objects.
Otherwise, the set of things not in `A` would be gigantic.

Lean enforces this even more strongly. Every set must be
relative to some universe. `A : set ℕ` means that
"`A` is a set of natural numbers," i.e., the universe is `ℕ`.
Similarly, `A : set U` means that the elements of `A` come
from some generic kind of objects that we call `U`.


## The set-element method

To prove that two sets are equal, one technique we saw was
to transform the equality into a universal statement about
membership : `A = B` means `∀ x : U, x ∈ A ↔ x ∈ B`.
The tactic for doing this is called `ext`, for "extensionality."
You give it a name for the variable `x`.

## Some new useful tactics

* `ext x`: if your goal is to show that two sets `A` and `B`
  are equal, `ext x` changes the goal to showing that
  `x ∈ A ↔ x ∈ B`. Remember, `split_goal` will then turn an `↔`
  statement into two implications!

* `set_simplify`: this one is fun! If you have any "set membership"
  statements, like `x ∈ Aᶜ`, in your hypothesis or goals,
  `set_simplify` will turn these statements into "logic."
  For example, `x ∈ Aᶜ` will become `¬ (x ∈ A)`.
  `x ∈ A ∩ B` will become `x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B`.

* `rewrite`: stands for "rewrite." `rewrite` will let us substitute patterns
  in place of equivalent or equal patterns. A good example here is
  De Morgan's laws, which are logical equivalences. If we are
  ever looking to prove a goal of the form `¬ (p ∧ q)`,
  `rewrite not_and_or` will use De Morgan's law to change the goal to
  `¬p ∨ ¬q`. The word `not_and_or` is the name Lean gives to this form
  of De Morgan's law.

  There are lots of laws (patterns, equivalences) that we can use with
  `rewrite`. For now, we'll just use a few. We don't expect you to go
  searching for these rules yourselves.

  You can figure out what a rule states using `#check`:

-/

#check not_and_or   -- De Morgan 1
#check not_or       -- De Morgan 2
#check not_not      -- Double negation elimination
#check or_comm      -- Changes the order of an "or"
#check and_comm     -- Changes the order of and "and"

Finally, some useful keyboard shortcuts:

* `∩`: \inter, \cap
* `∪`: \union, \cup
* `ᶜ`: We use this for "complement". \^c

Here's a proof using the set-element method:

-/

example (A B : Set U) : (A ∩ B)ᶜ = Aᶜ ∪ Bᶜ := by
  ext x
  split_goal
  { assume hx
    set_simplify
    rewrite not_and_or at hx
    assumption }
  { assume hx
    set_simplify
    rewrite not_and_or
    assumption }

Here's another. This one uses `rw` much more heavily!

The final goal has the form `p ↔ p`. The `reflexivity` tactic,
which we've seen once or twice already, closes goals like this.
`↔`, `=`, and some other relations are called *reflexive* because
for any `x`, `x ↔ x`, `x = x`, etc. are true.

example (A B : Set U) : (A \ B)ᶜ = B ∪ Aᶜ := by
  ext x
  set_simplify
  rewrite not_and_or
  rewrite not_not
  rewrite or_comm

## Bonus

We mentioned "De Morgan for quantifiers" in lecture.
Here's a proof of one direction of this.
The other direction is trickier: we need a new proof technique for it.

example (P : ℕ → Prop) : (¬ ∃ x, P x) ↔ (∀ x, ¬ P x)  := by
  split_goal                    -- To prove an ↔, prove both directions.

  { assume hne                   -- Suppose `¬ ∃ x, P x`.
    fix x                     -- Take an arbitrary `x`,
    assume hx                    -- and suppose for the sake of contradiction that `P x` holds.
    have hex : ∃ x, P x         -- We then know that `∃ x, P x` holds,
    { existsi x                 -- since `x` is a witness.
      assumption }
    contradiction }             -- This contradicts our original hypothesis.

  { assume hall                  -- For the other direction, suppose `∀ x, ¬ P x`.
    assume hex                   -- Suppose for the sake of contradiction `∃ x, P x`.
    eliminate hex with w hw     -- Then there is a witness `w` such that `P w` holds.
    have hnw : ¬ P w := hall w  -- But, from our first hypothesis, `¬ P w` also holds.
    contradiction }             -- Contradiction.

There are even rewrite rules for "De Morgan for quantifiers":

-/

#check not_forall
#check not_exists
